Since October 2023, I have been a PhD student in the [CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/) team at École Polytechnique (Paris), working at the intersection of reinforcement learning and federated learning. I am supervised by [Eric Moulines](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-moulines/), [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/), and [Karim Abed-Meraim](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/2293-karim-abed-meraim.html), and I also collaborate closely with [Paul Mangold](https://pmangold.fr/) and [Daniil Tiapkin](https://d-tiapkin.github.io/).

Before that, I studied at Télécom Paris and completed the [MVA Master’s](https://www.master-mva.com/) program.

My research interests include
- Federated Reinforcement Learning
- Theory of Reinforcement Learning
- Federated Learning and Personalization

======
-  *January 2026:* Two of my papers as a first-author were accepted at ICLR 2026 and AISTATS 2026, respectively: ["Beyond Softmax and Entropy: Convergence Rates of Policy Gradients with  
f-SoftArgmax Parameterization & Coupled Regularization"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=O93c9H4SXc) and ["On Global Convergence Rates for Federated Softmax Policy Gradient under Heterogeneous Environments"] (https://openreview.net/forum?id=aPAq9U7MFm)! I will attend both conferences to present my work. Feel free to come chat if you’d like to discuss federated learning or policy gradients!
-  *January 2025:* My first paper as a first-author ['Federated UCBVI: Communication-Efficient Federated Regret Minimization with Heterogeneous Agents'](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v258/labbi25a.html) has been accepted at AISTATS 2025!
-  *October 2023:* I am starting a PhD at Ecole Polytechnique!
