Since October 2023, I have been a PhD student in the [CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/) team at École Polytechnique (Paris), working at the intersection of reinforcement learning and federated learning. I am supervised by [Eric Moulines](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-moulines/), [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/), and [Karim Abed-Meraim](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/2293-karim-abed-meraim.html), and I also collaborate closely with [Paul Mangold](https://pmangold.fr/) and [Daniil Tiapkin](https://d-tiapkin.github.io/).

Before that, I studied at Télécom Paris and completed the [MVA Master’s](https://www.master-mva.com/) program.

My research interests include
- Federated Reinforcement Learning
- Theory of Reinforcement Learning
- Federated Learning and Personalization
